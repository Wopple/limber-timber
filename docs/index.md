# Introduction

Limber Timber is a database migrations tool written in python with flexibility in mind. It is the database migrations
tool I always wanted but never existed (until now).

### Migrations Written in Data

Data is trivial to parse and thus easy to manipulate. You describe the migrations in data, and Limber Timber does the rest.

### Inferred Down Migrations

Other migrations tools that support down migrations put the burden on the developer to implement them. Limber Timber
automatically infers the down migrations from the up migrations removing that burden from you.

### Separation of Database and Metadata

Limber Timber is not prescriptive about where you store your migrations table. You can even store it in a completely
different type of database! This gives you the flexibility you need to meet the task at hand.

### In-memory Support

There are many reasons you may want to run migrations in-memory.

- Unit tests
- Dry runs
- Only produce the migrations table
- Something else!

### Manifest

A manifest file lists the migrations to apply and the order to apply them in.

- No special naming conventions like timestamps in your migration files
- Produces git merge conflicts instead of breaking silently
- Allows for better organization with directories

### Error Recovery

Some backends (looking at you Big Query) do not support transactions for DDL queries. Limber Timber does its best to
fail in recoverable ways despite this limitation. In most cases, no manual intervention will be needed in the case of a
failure.

### Templates

Templating is usually hacked into migrations using string interpolation before running the migrations tool. In Limber
Timber, templates are first class. If you so choose to use string interpolation anyway, well... I hope you know what you
are doing!

### Scanning

I want people to use Limber Timber, so I need to make it easy for you to start using it. Scanning is a feature that
queries a schema or table and produces the migrations that would generate the same. Then you can run the migrations
in-memory to generate the metadata and voil√†, Limber Timber is ready to go.

### JSON Schema

(Coming Soon)

JSON Schema allows for integrated validation and code completion.
